# Emotion-Aware-Viterbox
This repository contains the research code for a Master thesis on
emotion-aware Vietnamese text-to-speech (TTS) using partial fine-tuning
of a large multilingual backbone model (Viterbox).

## Research Objective
- Study controllable emotional expression in Vietnamese TTS
- Inject emotion representations into an existing large-scale TTS backbone
- Analyze emotion consistency and disentanglement

## Key Contributions
1. Learnable emotion embedding integrated into the TTS text encoder
2. Partial fine-tuning strategy for emotion adaptation
3. Emotion consistency loss for stable emotional expression

## Backbone
- Viterbox (fine-tuned from Chatterbox by Dolly-VN)
